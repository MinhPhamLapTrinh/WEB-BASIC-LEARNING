        There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at
        the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely
        for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get
        a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards
        the village calling out “Wolf, Wolf,” and the villagers came out to
        meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable
        time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he
        tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But
        shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest,
        and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out
        “Wolf, Wolf,” still louder than before. But this time the villagers,
        who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again
        deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the
        Wolf made a good meal off the boys flock, and when the boy
        complained, the wise man of the village said: <br> <br>
        "A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.”<br><br>
